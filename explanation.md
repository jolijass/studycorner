For my portfolio, I have selected option two, which involves creating my own concepts and making new components and screens. My components include a list of flashcard decks, the option to add flashcards, and a quiz mode that allows users to study efficiently. Depending on the amount of characters used for creating flashcards, users have parameters but also lenciency (a.k.a input freedom) when it comes to making their own study tools.
